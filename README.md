# Filterable and interactive CogWork calendar

This is a wordpress plugin that displays a calendar that fetches information from dans.se (or other CogWork API)
and allows users to filter on courses, dance styles and more, and also see more detailed infomation on them. 

It's used by the Gothenburg swing dance association "WCJ" at https://wcj.se/kalender/.
Work is done to allow all clubs using CogWork to use it.
